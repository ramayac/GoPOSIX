## 🛠️ Open Issues by Tool

### 🔴 Highest Priority — Active Development


---

### 🟡 Medium Priority — Well-Defined, Scoped

#### `tar` — 4 failures + 4 skipped (27/31 pass, 87.1%) · coverage 75.4%

| # | Type | Count | Difficulty | Description |
|---|------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Failures | 3 | 🟡 Medium | Hardlink/symlink mode ordering — permission bits applied in wrong order |
| 2 | Failures | 1 | 🟡 Medium | XZ compression auto-detect (`.tar.xz`) not implemented |
| 3 | Skipped | 2 | 🟡 Medium | Auto-detect `.tar.gz`/`.tar.xz` on extract |
| 4 | Skipped | 2 | 🟡 Medium | Hardlink detection/dedup + mode preservation |
| 5 | Skipped | 1 | 🟢 Easy | Graceful rejection of empty `.tar.gz` files |

---

### 🟢 Low Priority / Deferred

#### `awk` — 17 failures + 8 skipped · coverage 90.0%

**Status**: Deferred. Root cause is the `goawk` v1.31.0 engine — upstream doesn't support bitwise ops, hex/octal constants, function arg parsing (4 tests), nested loop scoping, empty-paren handling, negative field access, continue/break edge cases, and backslash-newline handling.
- 8 additional tests skipped (large integer, NUL printf, invalid for/colon syntax, missing delete arg, gcc build bug).
- *See*: [wiki/deferred.md](deferred.md).

### ⚪ Root-Required — Cannot Test in CI (23 skipped)

Tests that need `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, kernel hotplug, or interactive shell — can only be validated manually. The other 2 of 25 total skipped are in the `awk` deferred section above.

| Tool | Skipped | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| `mdev` | 13 | Requires root + `/sys` kernel infrastructure (hotplug events, rule processing, move/command rules) |
| `cpio` | 7 | suid/sgid preservation, uid/gid defaults, `-R` owner flag, absolute path safety, zero-size hardlinks |
| `mount` | 1 | Requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` |
| `makedevs` | 1 | Device node creation requires root |
| `ash` | 1 | Needs interactive shell session |
| **Total** | **23** | |
